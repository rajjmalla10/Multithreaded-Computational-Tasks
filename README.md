# Multithreaded-Computational-Tasks


This project involves implementing four computational tasks using C, focusing on file input, mathematical formulas, and multithreading. The first task is developing a Linear Regression program to read coordinates from files, calculate the equation of a line (y = ax + b), and predict y for a given x. The second task calculates Pi using the Leibniz formula with user-defined iterations and multithreaded computation for performance. The third task identifies and counts prime numbers from multiple files using POSIX threads, ensuring equal workload distribution and efficient memory allocation with dynamic memory management. The final task applies a Gaussian Blur to a PNG image by averaging RGB values of surrounding pixels in a 3x3 matrix, using multithreading for faster processing and outputting the blurred image. These tasks showcase my expertise in file handling, dynamic memory, multithreading, and algorithm optimization, demonstrating a strong foundation in high-performance computing.
